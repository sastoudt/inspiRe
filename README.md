# inspiRe
This package is inspired by the `praise` package and StumbleUpon. The goal is to give you some inspiration as you prepare to tell a story with data by providing you with a random URL of someone else doing the same. The motivation for this package is also to tie into the [Data Science by Design](http://datasciencebydesign.org/) initiative. We want to have a community-contributed list of things that inspire us to be creative as we share our data work with the world.  

**How to install:**
